# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

This is an online reference and resource written by and for the Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program ([SWAMP](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/)) at the California State Water Resources Control Board ([State Water Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/)).

The SWAMP Team is composed of multiple team members at the State Water Board within the SWAMP Unit, SWAMP Information Management and Quality Assurance Center ([SWAMP IQ](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/swamp_iq/)), and others in the Office of Information Management and Analysis ([OIMA](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/)).

Content in this manual includes curated information that members of the SWAMP Team have found helpful to support onboarding/offboarding, collaboration, communication, and our collective culture. It is a place to document institutional knowledge and provide references to available resources.

This [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books) is an open, living, and continuously iterating resource. If you have suggestions for additions or revisions you think should be incorporated into this book, please follow the guidance provided in the [Contributing](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swamp-manual/contribute.html) chapter.
