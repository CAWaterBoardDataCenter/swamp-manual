It’s not something you are, it’s something you do”\n\nThe Culture Code, Daniel Coyle\n\nA culture is strong when people work with each other, for each other. A culture is weak when people work against each other, for themselves.\n\nSimon Sinek\n\n\nOur Values\nThe following four values are at the core of who we are and how we work as an office (OIMA) and within the SWAMP Unit at the Water Boards:\nWe build trust: we strive to be a trusted source of water data, information, and processes, and we invest the time and space required to build, rebuild, and maintain trusting relationships.\nWe adapt: we strive to be adaptable and innovative in how we work and the products, services, and resources we develop.\nWe work in partnership: collaboration and partnerships are key to who we are and how we work. We believe the way we work directly impacts what we produce.\nWe drive quality: we strive to produce quality information, data, products, and services. We know the quality of the systems and processes we use determine the outcomes we are able to achieve.\nSee the OIMA Values Statement for how each of these values have been operationalized into behaviors that we are all empowered, expected, and held accountable to demonstrating.",

    "text": "See the Equipment Section of the Onboarding Chapter for how to obtain your work computer & hardware. Your supervisor will help you with this process.\n\n\n\nRemote desktop and Virtual Private Network (VPN) enable staff to securely connect to the Water Board’s network and access various online resources including the Intranet (waternet) and shared drives.\n\nVPN is used on Water Boards’ approved devices to access the network when working remotely. See the VPN User Instructions.\nRemote desktop is used when the individual is working remotely but does not have access to a Water Boards device (i.e. when using a personal computer).\n\nRegardless of which option you use for remote access, all staff are required to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) when accessing the Water Boards’ network. See the Remote Access Guidence Page for instructions to set up your MFA method.\nYour supervisor and DIT can help you get set up.\n\n\n\nInstructions on how to install printer(s) near your cubicle in the office.\n\n\n\nUse your computer’s Software Center to download most programs. You can also download & install some programs outside of the Software Center, such as Git, which may have a more recent version than what the Software Center provides. Some external software will not play nice with the VPN (e.g., Slack) so keep that in mind if you’re unable to connect and use some software.\nAlso see this Business Intelligence Handbook for guidance on business intelligence tools (i.e., software) that are available to Water Boards staff.\nIf you have issues accessing or downloading any of the below software, email the IT Help Desk and they can help you download and/or troubleshoot.\n\n\nAll staff have access to Microsoft 365 applications, such as Outlook, Teams, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, SharePoint, OneDrive, and more.\nMany of these applications are already loaded onto state devices, and you can access them through any web browser:\n\nGo to the Office 365 Portal\nEnter your FULL username [Water Boards email address]\nFollow the prompts to get your email\nConfirm MFA when prompted\n\n\n\n\n\nArcGIS Pro is the main desktop GIS application available to Water Boards staff. ArcGIS Pro can be downloaded from the Software Center. If you do not see ArcGIS Pro in the Software Center, contact the Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov so that they can add it your list of available applications. Future releases of ArcGIS Pro and other ESRI applications should be automatically added to the Software Center as they are approved by DIT. You can use the Software Center to update your installation. \nThe Water Boards ArcGIS Portal (https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/) is an online platform for publishing and sharing ESRI-produced GIS resources with others at the Water Boards. These resources can also be shared with people outside of the Water Boards (with approval). For those familiar with ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Portal is the enterprise version of ArcGIS Online. With ArcGIS Portal, you can: \n\nCreate and share maps, story maps, and other applications \nSearch for GIS content within the Water Boards \nCreate groups to share GIS information with colleagues \nDownload maps, layers, and GIS data for use in ArcGIS Pro and other applications \n\nTo activate your Water Boards ArcGIS Portal membership (required for viewing, downloading, and publishing resources on the portal), email the DIT GIS Unit at gis@waterboards.ca.gov.  \nTo log into Portal, use the same username and password that you use for your state-issued laptop or computer. \n\nUsername: The default format is “[your work PC login]@EPA” (e.g. jsmith@EPA) OR “epa\\[your work PC login]” (e.g. epa\\jsmith) \nPassword: [your work PC password] \n\nPublic sharing: Resources published on the ArcGIS Portal can be shared outside of the organization to the public (no Portal log-in required), but this requires approval from the DIT GIS Unit. See the Public Sharing Requirements on the GIS Unit wiki (start [gis] (ca.gov)) and ensure that you complete each one of the steps before you submit a completed Public Publishing Form to the GIS Unit.

It is a powerful language in the field of data science.\nR Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) with support for both R and Python.\n\nBoth R and RStudio are available for installation in the Software Center. If you do not see either of them on the list of available programs, please contact the DIT Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov to request them.\nR Shiny is a platform for developing web applications using the R programming language. The State Water Board maintains a cloud-based Shiny account (shinyapps.io) that can be used to publish Shiny applications online. For more information, please see the Shiny publishing procedures and policy.\n\n\n\nSigning up:\n\nYou will need a GitHub account to access work-related & open-access projects in GitHub. Jenny Bryan (R developer and professor) provides some recommendations for signing up for a GitHub account.\nWe also strongly recommend setting up 2-factor authentication, which is required for becoming a member of the official Water Boards GitHub organization (see below). To keep things simple, you can use the same authentication system (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator) as you do for logging into the VPN.\n\nGetting access to the Water Boards Water Data Center GitHub\n\nWhy join? So you can easily work with other GitHub users in the Water Boards, as well as have a central place to publish projects relevant to other Water Boards colleagues & the public. The Water Boards GitHub organization also has a “sandbox” team to test & process projects before pushing them to public access.\nFollow link above to learn more and connect with the WB GitHub organization managers to introduce yourself & request to join the WB GitHub organization\n\nHow do I connect my Water Boards computer to Git/GitHub?\n\nWhile there is plenty of work you can do in the browser in GitHub, the real power comes in using it as a version control system connected to your local computer.\nFor all users, we recommend GitHub Desktop, which is available in the Software Center. There are lots of good resources on how GitHub Desktop works – here are a few of our favorites:\n\nThe “installing and configuring” section from GitHub docs. The other section is useful, but non-seasoned users can ignore information about forks, branches, and pull requests.\nA ~22 minute Youtube video from Coder Coder introducing GitHub Desktop setup and workflow. For some of the workflow options, the instructor uses VS Code. If you do not use VS Code, I suggest writing a brief .txt file using Notepad instead (e.g., the text `hello world!` saved as index.txt) and saving that file in the same place as your repository to continue with the walkthrough. Non-seasoned users can ignore the section on ignoring files, branching, and pull requests (though the explanation is good!)\n\nFor R users who want to integrate a Git tab in their RStudio window, we recommend following Jenny Bryan’s directions on Happy Git with R, sections 4-13. If you have any questions, the current R users in SWAMP are happy to chat with you.\nIf you use the command line to access Git/GitHub, congratulations! You likely know more about using Git than many of the people currently in SWAMP - and we’d love to learn from you!\n\n\n\n\nTableau is a business intelligence tool that can connect to and access data from a wide variety of data sources, perform data preparation and cleaning tasks, produce interactive visualizations and dashboards, and publish these products on the web.\nTableau Software for Desktop\n\nTableau Desktop is the full (or unrestricted) version of Tableau that can be installed onto one’s state-issued laptop or desktop computer. Once installed, it can be run as a desktop application and visualizations can be published on either Tableau Public or Tableau Server. A limited number of Tableau Desktop licenses are available to Water Boards staff. These  licenses are named licenses only (not shared) and are tied to a specific user. Contact the DIT Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov to request a license or contact Rafael Maestu (Rafael.Maestu@Waterboards.ca.gov) in OIMA for further guidance. \nTableau Desktop Public Edition is the free version of Tableau Desktop that is available to all Water Boards staff. The software can be downloaded from the Tableau Public website (Tableau Public Product Download). If you run into any permissions issues trying to install the software package on your computer, you may need to request that the DIT Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov install it for you. Compared to Tableau Desktop, Tableau Desktop Public Edition has a number of significant limitations (e.g., limited size and file type of data sources, inability to save Tableau workbooks to the desktop, inability to control access to the Tableau workbook or the underlying data), so it is likely only useful for evaluation purposes or projects with a very limited scope. \n\nTableau Server\n\nTableau Server is an online platform for creating, publishing, and sharing Tableau data sources, visualizations, and dashboards. Tableau Server is a web-based platform, so it does not require an installation of Tableau Desktop or Tableau Desktop Public Edition, but its functionality is enhanced when the two are used together. See our SharePoint page for more information about Tableau Server.\nAccess: Users with a Water Boards account (i.e., have an email address that ends with “@waterboards.ca.gov”) should be able to access the internal Tableau Server website (https://tableauint.waterboards.ca.gov/#/site). If you cannot log in, or if you need help publishing your dataset or visualization, email waterdata@waterboards.ca.gov.\nAdvantages: \n\nSharing data sources: Data sources published on Tableau Server can be shared with others on your team or with others in the organization. \nAutomation: Data visualizations and sources published on Tableau Server can be automatically refreshed on a time schedule.  \n\nLimitations:\n\nTableau Server can be used to create data visualizations and dashboards like you would in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Desktop Public Edition.\nMost of the functionality is the same; however, there are some differences. For example, Tableau Server does not provide as many options for customizing and formatting your visualization.\nRelated to this, transferring and viewing Tableau files between Tableau Desktop software and Tableau Server can result in formatting issues.  \n\n\nPublishing Tableau Visualizations \n\nVisualizations created in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Desktop Public Edition can be published on Tableau Server or Tableau Public. Visualizations created in Tableau Server are automatically published on Tableau Server (sharing permissions can be changed in Tableau Server). \n\nTableau Server: Requires Tableau Server access. See the Tableau Server section above. \nTableau Public: Requires a Tableau Public account. Free (self-registration). https://public.tableau.com/  \n\nOnce a visualization is published on Tableau Server or Tableau Public (and configured for public sharing), then that visualization can be embedded into a Water Boards web page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nReminder to add recommendations section once we hear about what RM recommends (i.e. Tableau Desktop Public or Tableau Server)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower BI is a business intelligence and data visualization software product developed by Microsoft used to create interactive data visualizations and dashboards. Additionally, it includes a collection of tools that can be used to clean, transform, and aggregate data. There is significant overlap with Tableau, so it is usually not necessary to have/use both Power BI and Tableau at the same time, but you are welcome to try both.\nAccess: If Power BI Desktop is not already installed on your workstation, check the Software Center and see if it is available there. If it’s not available, then contact the DIT Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov to request the software. Once installed, open the software and log in using your Windows account. If you cannot log in, then you may need to contact the DIT Help Desk for an account.\nPower BI Web App, the online version of Power BI that does not require installation of the desktop software, can be accessed here (https://app.powerbigov.us/). Similar to the desktop app, you may need to contact the DIT Help Desk for access if you cannot log in using your Windows account. The Web App does not have the full functionality of the desktop software, but generally speaking it is easier to share your work and collaborate with others on the web version of Power BI.\nPublishing Power BI visualizations: TBD - need to find out what is the process for publishing Power BI projects and if it requires DIT permission.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the majority of our internal meetings use Microsoft Teams, meetings with external partners or the public may require the Zoom platform.\nDownload the Zoom application through the Software Center.\n\n\nSee the Zoom Getting Started Resources (Participants Tab) to learn how to join and actively participate in someone else’s Zoom Meeting or Webinar.\n\n\n\nThe Water Boards has a Zoom license, which enables our staff to host zoom meetings or webinars. Use Zoom meetings when communicating with select external partners and use Zoom webinar for large, publicly facing events. See Meeting vs Webinar comparison.\nWork with your supervisor to gain access to the OIMA Zoom Account and/or to get help scheduling a Zoom Meeting or Webinar.\nSee the Zoom Getting Started Resources (Hosts/Co-Hosts Tab) to learn how to schedule and manage your own Zoom Meeting or Webinar. Also see Zoom Hosting Tips.\n\n\nOnce you have a zoom meeting scheduled, there are a couple of steps we recommend you take before you send out invitations:\n\nWhoever schedules the meeting and has access to the OIMA Zoom account should open the meeting, scroll to the Zoom meeting’s “Time” section, click the Outlook Button.\nClick on the downloaded .ics file to open the zoom meeting invitation - this will add it to your outlook calendar. \nClick “Invite Attendees”\nAdd the OIMA Zoom email to the required attendees list. Add any Water Boards co-hosts to the Optional Section. Do NOT include your external partners yet!\nSave the Meeting Invite.\nCreate & complete a separate Outlook Meeting invitation - you will forward this invitation to your external partners. Note that we do this because the automatically created zoom invite restricts our ability to create nicely formatted text in the meeting invitation.\n\nCreate a “New Meeting” in Outlook\nPopulate the Meeting Invitation will all necessary information (e.g. Title, Required and Optional Attendees, Start/End time, Location (write Zoom), Body of the invite)\nNavigate back into Zoom’s meeting information, “Invite Link” section, click “Copy Invitation”\nIn the “Copy Meeting Invitation” pop-up, click the “Copy Meeting Invitation” button, and then press “Cancel”\nNavigate back into your Outlook Meeting Invitation, paste the Zoom Meeting Invitation information at the bottom of the invite\nWe recommend\n\nDeleting the top three lines of the meeting invitation information (i.e. everything above “Join Zoom Meeting”)\nSelecting the “Join Zoom Meeting” and Invitation Link URL in the Zoom meeting and (1) Increase the size to 14 pt font, and (2) Bold the text.\n\nReview your Outlook Meeting invitation to:\n\nConfirm all of the correct emails are included in the invitation\nConfirm the date and time in: zoom and outlook all match\nCheck for and correct spelling or formatting errors\n\nPress send!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are hosting a Zoom Meeting (or Webinar), you (or whoever in OIMA helped you schedule the meeting/webinar) will need to login to Zoom and start the Zoom Meeting (or Webinar).\nWe recommend logging into your Zoom Meeting (or Webinar) 5-20 minutes early to get set up, grant permissions to co-hosts, and complete any other preparation you need to ensure your meeting runs smoothly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Microsoft Teams, Teams are groups of people brought together for work, projects, or common interests. We utilize Teams Communities, Channels, and direct chat messages to communicate and stay in touch asynchronously (i.e. outside of meetings). See Get Started with Microsoft Teams and the Communication Section for recommended use of Teams and norms for SWAMP communications.\nYour supervisor will add you to any OIMA or SWAMP Teams Channels or Group Chats (e.g., OIMA Team, Unit Group Chat).\n\n\nYou can also join the Water Boards Data Community to connect with folks across all State Water Board Regions, Divisions, and Offices.

    "text": "Here is a non-comprehensive, but hopefully informative guide to onboarding to the SWAMP Unit. The majority of this information in this section is aimed towards starting at SWAMP as a rank-and-file (non-supervisory) state employee. Please re-reference this page throughout your time at SWAMP!\n\n\nIn your first week, your supervisor will help you:\n\nGet access to your Water Boards email\nGet any equipment or supplies you need (e.g. laptop, office supplies)\nGet a badge to enter the CalEPA building (as appropriate)\n\nSee Cardkey Activation Program Procedures\n\nReview & sign paperwork\n\nFellows & Interns will need to have the following compiled & signed\n\nProject Description (the one submitted with the original host application)\nSTD 689-Oath of Allegiance\nEmergency Notification Request form\nInternet/Intranet Policy Certificate\nWelcome Letter\nLetter of Agreement\nDuty Statement\n\n\nForward relevant meeting invitations and other information to you, such as:\n\nSWAMP Unit Meetings\nSWAMP Roundtable Meetings\nOptional SWAMPside coworking Meetings\nOIMA All-Staff Meetings\nOther meetings that will be relevant to your work\n\nGet added to relevant email lists, such as:\n\nSWAMP Roundtable email list\nOIMA All-Staff email list\n\nGet added to relevant Microsoft Teams Channels & Group Chats, such as:\n\nOIMA Data Team\nWater Boards Data Community Team\nSWAMP Unit Chat\n\n\nWe recommend you take some time to:\n\nGo through this manual and familiarize yourself with SWAMP, OIMA, and the Water Boards\n\nFor Fellows & Interns, the rest of this Onboarding section may not apply to you (e.g. HR Forms, etc.) - your supervisor can provide guidance on what is relevant to you.\n\nInstall any software you will need (see the Tech Setup & Support Section for guidance)\n\nIf you will need to install a lot of different programs, we recommend working with DIT to bulk install programs. Programs that are commonly used in SWAMP that benefit from bulk installation by DIT include:\n\nArcGIS Pro, PowerBI, Tableau (folks usually prefer and install one over the others)\nR & RStudio\nGit\nZoom\n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with Microsoft Teams, Outlook, any other software you may use (see the Communication Section for communication norms, resources, and expectations)\nReview the New Employee Orientation Resources & make a note of state holidays on your calendar\nAdd any known / already approved time off to your calendar (see the Work Schedule Section for guidance)\nFamiliarize yourself with resources related to the project(s) you will be working on\nMeet others in SWAMP/OIMA and others that you’ll work with on your project(s)\nTake any mandatory training (e.g. IT Security, Field Safety)\nReview optional training available through the Training Academy and sign up for courses of interest. (See the Training Section for more guidance). Note that it might take about four weeks before new staff are able to access Cornerstone. It’s recommended that new staff:\n\nTry logging in once or twice per week until successful.\nBEFORE each log in attempt, be sure to “clear cache” before (re)visiting the MyApps & clicking Cornerstone. If the cache is not cleared, the error message auto-populates, even after access is granted.\n\nASK QUESTIONS! You’ll probably have a lot of questions as you settle in - please don’t hesitate to ask your supervisor and/or team members as they come up!\n\n\n\n\nAll staff are assigned a laptop (typically Dell or HP) that they can use at home and the office. The Water Boards only uses PCs and does not generally support any Mac-based hardware. Office workstations are set up with two wide screen monitors, keyboard, mouse and docking station where you plug in your laptop.\nIf you find you need different or additional equipment at your office or home desk (e.g., to make your workspace more ergonomic with a wireless keyboard or mouse), please speak to your supervisor who can work with you and IT to make the appropriate requests. Ergonomic equipment may be made available through a Reasonable Accommodation Request (intranet link requires VPN login). Work with your supervisor for guidance on preparing the request.\nEquipment available to take home includes: laptop, laptop bag, standard monitor, keyboard, mouse, headset, adjustable monitor stand, adjustable tilting laptop stand. To request additional equipment or to report issues with any of your equipment, send an email to the IT Help Desk. This will log a ticket in their tracking system and they will respond typically the same day.\n\n\n\nThe Telework Policy for CalEPA and the Water Boards allows remote-centered work options for all staff as long as business needs can be met.\nAll staff are required to fill out a Work Week Agreement and Telework Agreement that specifies where you will typically work on a given day of the week (office or remote) and your typical work hours. All employees (including Student Assistants, Retired Annuitants, Supervisors and Managers) are required to complete both agreements, regardless of their telework or work week status.\nYour Work Week Agreement and Telework Agreement need to be created in BizFlow within 2 months of starting work. All Telework Agreements and Work Week Agreements must be reviewed and updated on an annual basis each calendar year in January.\nAs of December 2024, OIMA still maintains enough office space that staff will be assigned a cubicle or personal workstation in the CalEPA building whether or not they primarily work remotely.\n\n\nBelow are the approved work schedules.\n\nRegular/Standard or Fixed Work Schedules - In accordance with Government Code 19851 a regular work schedule is defined as five (5) days a week, eight (8) hours a day and not more than 40 hours a week. If you are on a regular work schedule, please complete the agreement with a work schedule that reflects this.\nAlternate Work Schedules (AWS) have been released, therefore, please review the applicable AWS before recertifying your AWS agreement. Please note, your AWS agreement must match the CalHR AWS otherwise it will be rejected. Also see: Calendars for Alternate Work Week Schedules\nFlex Schedule, in accordance with CalHR policy, Flex Schedule is defined as “An arrangement that permits employees to flex or adjust their start and end times, so long as the employee has worked his/her scheduled number of hours per day.” Therefore, you must have either an Alternate Work Schedule or a Regular Work schedule regardless of whether you have a Flex Schedule. At no time may a Flex Schedule result in overtime hours worked.\nExempt employees on other than a Regular/Standard or Fixed Work schedule (e.g., AWS, Flex time), please refer to the CalHR Human Resources Manual.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you review all sections of the Telework Agreement prior to submitting it (e.g., alternate work location, telework day(s), etc.).\nIf you are NOT teleworking or not eligible to telework, you still need to perform an annual review of your agreement and recertify that you are not teleworking.\n\n\n\n\nLog in to Bizflow:\nSelect “Self-Service” then “Work Items” and “Employee Self-Service Work List”\nSelect the Agreement by clicking on the word “Review” (blue link)\nYour form will contain information from the previous year. Make any necessary changes.\nCheck all the acknowledgment boxes on both forms.\nSelect the appropriate approvers. If you are unsure who your approvers are, please check with your Supervisor.\nFrom the drop-down menu at the top left, choose “Submit Request” then click the green check box button.\n\nFor more information, visit the Telework Program Page.\n\n\n\n\nOn your starting day, you will receive a package of forms and documents from the HR department including your duty statement, tax forms, direct deposit forms, questionaires (diversity, military), CalPERS forms, leave forms, and medical insurance forms\nYou will also be asked to submit a photocopy of either your passport or a combination of your driver’s license and social security card to the HR representative (currently Alicyn Chappelle). All forms apart from the medical insurance forms must be submitted within the first couple of days. Medical insurance forms must be submitted within the first 60 days for you to qualify for enrollment; however, the sooner you submit these forms the sooner you will have health coverage.\n\n\n\nEach classification within the SWAMP unit is associated with a bargaining unit. The bargaining units, with the State, determine many of the benefits & guidelines described here. For that reason, you should read the latest contract or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for your bargaining unit to determine benefits as applicable for you. Additional benefits specific to your bargaining unit may exist for you based on the MOU that are not described in this manual. Finally, supervisory positions may have varying benefits beyond those listed in this manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWAMP Position Classification\nBargaining Unit\nCBID\n\n\n\n\nScientific Aid\n11\nR11\n\n\nEnvironmental Scientist (incl. Senior Specialist)\n10\nR10\n\n\nAGPA\n1\nR01\n\n\nSenior Environmental Scientist - Supervisory\n10\nS10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen onboarded, employees in most classifications will be able to select a leave type: annual leave vs. vacation/sick leave. Comparisons of leave accrual and use between leave types are available in this chart.\nImportant FAQ for leave types:\n\nYou are only allowed to switch leave types every 2 years. Check with our HR liaison about switching leave types.\nLeave types are also connected to different types of non-work-related disability leave, which may impact your income should you need to go on disability leave. Non-work-related disability leave types are compared for Unit 10 employees on this flyer. More information about non-work-related disability leave is also available on the EDD website.\nLeave accrual can be impacted by the number of days/hours you work in a month.\n\nNeed additional leave?\nUnder the Voluntary Personal Leave Program, you can exchange a percentage of your salary to accrue additional leave hours per month. See the link above for more information, and contact our personnel specialist for more details.\n\n\n\nCalPERS is the California Public Employees Retirement System, which you will be enrolled in as a new employee. It provides benefits including medical coverage (health, dental, and vision insurance) and retirement for employees of the state of California.\n\n\nYou should select health insurance by submitting the appropriate forms within 60 days of starting with the State. If you select health insurance, you will pay the difference between what the state provides for healthcare (a base amount monthly) and the monthly cost for your selected health insurance. This amount is removed from your monthly paycheck. Employees may elect to receive cash in lieu of their state-sponsored medical insurance and/or dental insurance plan through the FlexElect program. You must certify you have qualifying group health and/or dental insurance through a spouse, domestic partner, or other source. FlexElect cash is distributed monthly.\nYou can make changes to your health, dental, and vision insurance selections two ways:\n\nAnnually during open enrollment, which occurs in the fall of each year. Your new insurance selections begin the following January.\nAfter a qualifying event in your life.\n\nTo learn more about the health coverage available to you, please visit the CalPERS website as well as the website for your bargaining unit to learn about costs specific to you. We include some helpful links below:\n\nCalPERS Health Program Guide (pdf) – broad overview of the health program\nCalPERS 2023 Health Benefits Summary (pdf) – description of different health plans and their statewide availability\nCalPERS 2023 Plans & Rates (web link)\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about your CalPERS retirement benefits on their website, which includes retirement planning checklists, calculators, classes, and explanations of benefits.\n\n\n\n\nStaff should complete and submit their timesheets by the 25th of each month. Direct deposit typically hits the last day of the pay period (end of the month), potentially earlier if you use a credit union.\nIt typically takes ~1 month for new staff to be entered in the electronic timesheet system (BizFlow), so the first timesheet is done by filling out an excel template.\n\n\nLogging in: To login you must use MS Edge browser and be connected to VPN (or on the network at CalEPA building). Use your workstation username (waterboards email address) and password to login.\neTimesheets: From the menu, – click the eTimesheet tab –&gt; eTimesheet Process –&gt; Current eTimesheet to begin. Select the pay period (month) to load a timesheet. All work hours must be associated with a Task ID – your supervisor will provide this, and it will be saved on all future timesheets. Work hours go on page 1, leave hours go on page 2. Use the &gt; and &lt; symbols on the timesheet to navigate between pages. Make sure your total hours fit the expected hours at the bottom of the timesheet, both monthly and daily, unless otherwise directed by your supervisor. Once complete, sign the 1st page of the timesheet, change status in the upper left corner to “Submit to Supervisor”, and click the green check box to complete the process.\nBizFlow Tips\n\nFor first-time users and info on how to change your settings, see Instructions on how to use BizFlow (intranet site; requires VPN login)\nCheck out the FAQs\n\n\n\n\nYou can view and download your paystubs from the Cal Employee Connect portal. Your supervisor will request login information for you from HR (personnel specialist) after your first paycheck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLeave balances are included on your paystubs and can be tracked in Cal Employee Connect, but they are always a month (or more) behind. You may want to track them in real-time in your own spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can choose from a number of different options for getting to and from the office on days you are working in person. The Intranet web page on employee transportation services is a good place to find resources on parking, transit, and bicycle commuting.\nCar commuters can park at hourly meters along the streets in Downtown Sacramento or use a parking garage - City Hall Garage is the closest to the office. See the Intranet web page on parking for more information, including discounted rates available for staff and carpoolers.\nWalking and biking are good options for local folks. Many streets have bike lanes, and the CalEPA office has a secure bike room. To use the bike room, contact transit@calepa.ca.gov to have them add access to your building badge.\nSacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) provides information on public transport, including the light rail and bus schedules. Staff may purchase transit passes at discounted rates through a Connect Card and may receive a subsidy on public transit passes up to $325 per month. See the public transit web page on the Intranet for more information.\n\nThe amount of subsidy you are eligible for depends on what bargaining unit you belong to. See this CalHR web page for the most up-to-date numbers based on the current collective bargaining contract language.\nTo claim your public transit subsidy, visit the CalEPA Employee Transit Office (office hours) located on the first floor in the Visitor Services Center. The staff there will issue you a Connect Card that you will need to register on the SacRT Connect Card website. Use the SacRT website to manage your card and load new funds, as needed. Note: You cannot use a personal (existing) Connect Card to access the subsidized funds. You will need to obtain a new card issued by the CalEPA Employee Transit Office.\n\nIf you commute by means other than a vehicle at least 60% of the time, you are eligible to sign up for the Incidental Use Parking Program (IUPP), which allows you to sign out passes for the City Hall parking garage 3 times per month.\n\n\n\nSee here for a list of amenities in the CalEPA office building. These include a child development center, a fitness center with lockers and showers, and a café (has not reopened as of November 2024).\nDowntown Sacramento has many events, restaurants, and shops close by the office. Across the street from the building you can find César Chávez Park, which hosts the Bodega Days market on Thursdays from 10-1 and free Concerts in the Park on Fridays 5-9pm in the summer months as well as the restaurant La Cosecha, which includes a small coffee shop.\nCoffee shops near the office include Café Immortal, Cora Coffee, Temple, and Starbucks. Restaurants include Octopus Peru, Nash & Proper, Mayahuel, Brasserie du Monde, and Ella.\nSacramento is home to the Kings (major league basketball team), River Cats (minor league baseball team), and Republic FC (soccer team). The stadiums they play in host many other events throughout the year, along with CalExpo and the SAFE Credit Union Convention Center. The Downtown Commons is a mixed-use outdoor shopping and entertainment center with restaurants, shops, and a movie theater.",

If you select health insurance, you will pay the difference between what the state provides for healthcare (a base amount monthly) and the monthly cost for your selected health insurance. This amount is removed from your monthly paycheck. Employees may elect to receive cash in lieu of their state-sponsored medical insurance and/or dental insurance plan through the FlexElect program. You must certify you have qualifying group health and/or dental insurance through a spouse, domestic partner, or other source.

Your new insurance selections begin the following January.\nAfter a qualifying event in your life.\n\nTo learn more about the health coverage available to you, please visit the CalPERS website as well as the website for your bargaining unit to learn about costs specific to you.

The Intranet web page on employee transportation services is a good place to find resources on parking, transit, and bicycle commuting.\nCar commuters can park at hourly meters along the streets in Downtown Sacramento or use a parking garage - City Hall Garage is the closest to the office. See the Intranet web page on parking for more information, including discounted rates available for staff and carpoolers.\nWalking and biking are good options for local folks. Many streets have bike lanes, and the CalEPA office has a secure bike room. To use the bike room, contact transit@calepa.ca.gov to have them add access to your building badge.\nSacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) provides information on public transport, including the light rail and bus schedules. Staff may purchase transit passes at discounted rates through a Connect Card and may receive a subsidy on public transit passes up to $325 per month. See the public transit web page on the Intranet for more information.\n\nThe amount of subsidy you are eligible for depends on what bargaining unit you belong to. See this CalHR web page for the most up-to-date numbers based on the current collective bargaining contract language.\nTo claim your public transit subsidy, visit the CalEPA Employee Transit Office (office hours) located on the first floor in the Visitor Services Center. The staff there will issue you a Connect Card that you will need to register on the SacRT Connect Card website. Use the SacRT website to manage your card and load new funds, as needed. Note: You cannot use a personal (existing) Connect Card to access the subsidized funds. You will need to obtain a new card issued by the CalEPA Employee Transit Office.\n\nIf you commute by means other than a vehicle at least 60% of the time, you are eligible to sign up for the Incidental Use Parking Program (IUPP), which allows you to sign out passes for the City Hall parking garage 3 times per month.\n\n\n\nSee here for a list of amenities in the CalEPA office building. These include a child development center, a fitness center with lockers and showers, and a café (has not reopened as of November 2024).\nDowntown Sacramento has many events, restaurants, and shops close by the office. Across the street from the building you can find César Chávez Park, which hosts the Bodega Days market on Thursdays from 10-1 and free Concerts in the Park on Fridays 5-9pm in the summer months as well as the restaurant La Cosecha, which includes a small coffee shop.\nCoffee shops near the office include Café Immortal, Cora Coffee, Temple, and Starbucks. Restaurants include Octopus Peru, Nash & Proper, Mayahuel, Brasserie du Monde, and Ella.\nSacramento is home to the Kings (major league basketball team), River Cats (minor league baseball team), and Republic FC (soccer team). The stadiums they play in host many other events throughout the year, along with CalExpo and the SAFE Credit Union Convention Center. The Downtown Commons is a mixed-use outdoor shopping and entertainment center with restaurants, shops, and a movie theater.",

    "text": "All SWAMP activities align with some component of the data life cycle, which consists of the seven phases outlined below. Here, we provide resources the SWAMP Team uses to effectively implement each phase.\n\n\nThe SWAMP Team, and all of the individuals within it, tend to have a number of co-occurring projects that are meant to help us advance and ultimately achieve our Mission. Managing multiple projects at once, given our limited resources – time, funding, capacity (i.e. one person can only do so much in a day!) can be challenging – so we like to make time to review all of our projects and prioritize them. This helps us focus our efforts and resources so that we can continue to make progress while also maintaining balance and preventing staff burnout.\nHere are some opportunities to plan & prepare SWAMP projects and activities which serve our mission:\nSWAMP Strategic Planning: Every three years or so, the SWAMP Team reviews and updates the SWAMP Strategic Plan to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth.\nProgram Work Plans: Every three years or so, SWAMP Program Leads review and update their program’s Work Plans to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth.\nIndividual Work Plans: In December/January of each year, we recommend taking time to update individual work plans to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth. This is also a good time to review and update Individual Development Plans, if staff have them!\n\n\n\nFor SWAMP Statewide Monitoring Programs, data collection and processing generally occurs sometime between March and October each year. This time frame can vary for each Statewide Monitoring Program so it’s best to review each Program’s Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for specific sampling and processing timelines.\nThe SWAMP Team does so much more than manage and coordinate SWAMP Statewide Monitoring Programs! For those projects, data collection and processing can look very different. Usually it comes in the form of engagement with internal and external partners, listening to the needs of communities that can most benefit from SWAMP data, information, and products, and figuring out how to operationalize and evolve our products and systems to better serve those communities and our partners. This process tends to be ongoing, although there may also be focused and concentrated periods where this listening and learning occurs.\n\n\n\nFor SWAMP Statewide Monitoring Programs, data analysis and quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) procedures are coordinated by SWAMP IQ, and specific components of the QAQC process can be found on the SWAMP IQ website or in each Program’s QAPP.\nFor SWAMP projects that are separate from statewide monitoring efforts, we work with our partners to test, “ground truth”, and explore the efficacy of our products and services. This can be separate from or simultaneous to the engagement and learning described in the “Collect and Process” step above. Similarly, this process tends to be ongoing, although there may also be focused and concentrated periods where this listening and learning occurs.\n\n\n\nCurrently, data and information generated by SWAMP are stored in a number of different places. The SWAMP Team is working on developing a standard and consistent data and document retention system.

Sometimes this can occur quickly, other times we make note and incorporate things into the next strategic planning opportunity. See the Plan and Prepare section above for more details.\n\n\n\nFor SWAMP Statewide Monitoring Programs, data are described through metadata and data dictionaries that are available on the SWAMP IQ website, via the database where data are downloaded (e.g. CEDEN, CA Open Data Portal).\nFor SWAMP Projects that are separate from statewide monitoring efforts, information and context about the project can be found in specific project documentation. Examples of documentation we use include GitHub repositories and the tools within them (e.g., ReadMes and GitHub issues), data flow diagrams, and reproducible workflows.\nThe SWAMP Team is also using this Manual to document the more nuanced parts of how we do what we do so that it’s easier for folks to find what they need to do their work.",
