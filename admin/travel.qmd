### **General Travel Process**

1.  Get approval to travel; if traveling for training or a conference - see the [Training section](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swamp-manual/admin/training.html) for forms that must be completed and approved before booking travel arrangements

2.  Book your travel (flights, hotels, rental cars) using the [CalTravelStore / Concur](http://www.caltravelstore.com/) system.

3.  Travel to and from your destination and **save all receipts** (see Tip #2 below for details)

4.  Submit your **Travel Expense Claim** for reimbursement - this is currently a 3-step process:

    1.  Gather your receipts and complete your TEC in [CalATERS Global](https://www.sco.ca.gov/calaters_global.html) - save a PDF of the TEC for use in Step 2 below

    2.  Complete the Adobe Sign process to get you TEC digitally signed and approved

    3.  Once you received a digitally signed version of your TEC, submit that and all of your required *original* receipts to Accounting. This can be done by dropping of your TEC package in-person in the CalEPA building, or mailing it in using the address provided on page 1 of your TEC.

### **Tips**

1.  **Ask your Supervisor for a copy of the Adobe Sign Instruction guide** - this will walk you through the 3-step TEC process above in more detail.

2.  Receipts should be submitted for every item of expense of \$25 or more. When receipts are not required to be submitted with a travel expense claim, it is the employee's responsibility to maintain receipts and records of their actual expenses. Read more information on reimbursement [here.](https://hrmanual.calhr.ca.gov/Home/ManualItem/1/2203)  

3.  Know your [reimbursement rates](https://www.calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/travel-reimbursements.aspx)! State employees may be eligible to receive reimbursement for expenses such as:

    -   Method of travel (transportation)
    -   Meals and incidentals
    -   Short-term lodging
    -   Out-of-state travel
    -   Out-of-country travel
    -   Personal vehicle mileage 
    -   Other actual and necessary business and/or travel costs incurred while conducting official state business

4.  Airline reservations should be made **no more than 30 days** prior to the expected travel dates.

    -   Department of General Services (DGS) recommends booking flights **between 21 to 30 days** prior to travel.

    -   **Frequent travelers should book non-refundable fares** since there is a high probability that the unused funds will be used for future travel within the expiration period.

    -   **Non-frequent travelers should book non-refundable fares** if the trips dates are fixed and there is a low probability of a change in plans.
