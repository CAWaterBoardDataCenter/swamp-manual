# Contributing

## Who can contribute

Currently, only members of the SWAMP Team are able to actively contribute to this manual.

## How we contribute

We develop the content for this SWAMP Manual using RStudio, build the book using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (via RStudio), and collaborate and publish using GitHub (also via RStudio).

If you are *NOT* a member of the SWAMP Team, but have suggestions for additions or revisions you think should be incorporated into this book, please email your suggestions to [swamp\@waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:swamp@waterboards.ca.gov).

### Setup

To contribute, SWAMP Team members must do the following, and it should only take about 20 minutes to complete:

1.  **Install R and RStudio**

    Both R and RStudio should be available in the Software Center (for Windows 10) or Company Portal (for Windows 11) -- if you don't see them in your Software Center/Company Portal or you have issues/questions during the instillation process, please send a request to the DIT HelpDesk and they can help you install them.

    Also see these [step by step instructions on how to install these programs](https://www.r4wrds.com/intro/m_install_r) -- you will only need to go through steps 1 and 2

    If you are new to R, it would also be helpful if you could review the [Getting Started Module](https://www.r4wrds.com/intro/m_getting_started.html) so you can begin to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of the program.

2.  **Install Quarto**

3.  **Create a GitHub Account**

4.  **Download and Install Git**

    Follow your operating system's normal [Git installation process](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Note: you will not see an application called Git listed but if the installation process completed it was likely successful, and we will confirm together.
