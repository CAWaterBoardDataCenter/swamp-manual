# SWAMP Culture {.unnumbered}

In SWAMP we understand that our culture is a result of our shared core values and our behaviors - and we take actions to support a culture that makes SWAMP a place we want to work.

> Culture is a set of living relationships working towards a shared goal. It's not something you are, it's something you do"

*The Culture Code, Daniel Coyle*

> A culture is strong when people work with each other, for each other. A culture is weak when people work against each other, for themselves.

*Simon Sinek*

# Our Values

The following four values are at the core of who we are and how we work as an office (OIMA) and within the SWAMP Unit at the Water Boards:

**We build trust:** we strive to be a trusted source of water data, information, and processes, and we invest the time and space required to build, rebuild, and maintain trusting relationships.

**We adapt:** we strive to be adaptable and innovative in how we work and the products, services, and resources we develop.

**We work in partnership:** collaboration and partnerships are key to who we are and how we work. We believe the way we work directly impacts what we produce.

**We drive quality:** we strive to produce quality information, data, products, and services. We know the quality of the systems and processes we use determine the outcomes we are able to achieve.

See the [OIMA Values Statement](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/docs/oima-values-statement-2023.pdf) for how each of these values have been operationalized into behaviors that we are all empowered, expected, and held accountable to demonstrating.
